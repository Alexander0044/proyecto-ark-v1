## 🚀 About The Project

ARK ASA HUB is a responsive multi-page web application developed with React and Vite.  
The goal of the project is to demonstrate:

- Component-based architecture
- Clean folder structure and naming conventions
- JSON data rendering
- Third-party component integration (Leaflet)
- Responsive design using Flexbox and media queries

The home page displays featured creatures dynamically loaded from a JSON array, including their danger level, diet, biome, and description.

An interactive custom map of **The Island** has been implemented using React Leaflet and ImageOverlay.
